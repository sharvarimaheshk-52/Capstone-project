    <h2>What Is Depression ?</h2>
    <p>Depression (major depressive disorder) is a common and serious medical illness that negatively affects how you feel, the way you think and how you act.Depression, also known as major depressive disorder, is a mood disorder that makes you feel constant sadness or lack of interest in life.
Most people feel sad or depressed at times. It’s a normal reaction to loss or life's challenges. But when intense sadness -- including feeling helpless, hopeless, and worthless -- lasts for many days to weeks and keeps you from living your life, it may be something more than sadness. You could have clinical depression, a treatable medical condition.</p>

<h2>Symptoms Of Depression</h2>
<p>According to the DSM-5, a manual doctors use to diagnose mental disorders, you have depression when you have five or more of these symptoms for at least 2 weeks: <br>
  <li>Your mood is depressed for most of the day, especially in the morning</li>
  <li>You feel tired or have a lack of energy almost every day.</li>
  <li>You feel worthless or guilty almost every day.</li>
  <li>You have a hard time focusing, remembering details, and making decisions.</li>
  <li>You can’t sleep, or you sleep too much, almost every day.</li>
  <li>You have almost no interest or pleasure in many activities nearly every day.</li>
  <li>You think often about death or suicide (not just a fear of death).</li>
  <li>You feel restless or slowed down.
    You’ve lost or gained weight.</li>

  <h1>Causes of Depression</h1>
  <p>There are several possible causes of depression. They can range from biological to circumstantial.

    Common causes include: <br>
    <li><b> Family history.</b> You’re at a higher risk for developing depression if you have a family history of depression or another mood disorder.
</li>

<li>
  <b> Early childhood trauma.</b> Some events affect the way your body reacts to fear and stressful situations.
</li>
<li><b>Brain Structure. </b>There’s a greater risk for depression if the frontal lobe of your brain is less active. However, scientists don’t know if this happens before or after the onset of depressive symptoms. </li>
<li><b>Medical Conditions.</b> Certain conditions may put you at higher risk, such as chronic illness, insomnia, chronic pain, or attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).
</li>
<li><b>Drug Use. </b>A history of drug or alcohol misuse can affect your risk.
</li>

<h1>Is It Depression ?</h1>
<p>The death of a loved one, loss of a job or the ending of a relationship are difficult experiences for a person to endure. It is normal for feelings of sadness or grief to develop in response to such situations. Those experiencing loss often might describe themselves as being “depressed.”
  But being sad is not the same as having depression. The grieving process is natural and unique to each individual and shares some of the same features of depression. But There is a difference:
  <li>In grief, painful feelings come in waves, often intermixed with positive memories of the deceased. In major depression, mood and/or interest (pleasure) are decreased for most of two weeks.</li>
  <li>In grief, self-esteem is usually maintained. In major depression, feelings of worthlessness and self-loathing are common.</li>
  <li>In grief, thoughts of death may surface when thinking of or fantasizing about “joining” the deceased loved one. In major depression, thoughts are focused on ending one’s life due to feeling worthless or undeserving of living or being unable to cope with the pain of depression.</li>
  <p> Grief and depression can co-exist For some people, the death of a loved one, losing a job or being a victim of a physical assault or a major disaster can lead to depression. <br>
  Distinguishing between grief and depression is important and can assist people in getting the help, support or treatment they need.</p>
