    <p> COVID-19 itself can lead to neurological and mental complications, such as delirium, agitation, and stroke. People with pre-existing mental, neurological or substance use disorders are also more vulnerable to SARS-CoV-2 infection ̶ they may stand a higher risk of severe outcomes and even death. <br>
    But, don't let that overwhelm you. Remember it is very normal to feel stressed about these situations, and there are a number of things you can do if it is starting to overwhelm you :
</p>
<li>Keep a record of where you’ve been and who you’ve seen. This will help with rapid contact tracing if it’s required.</li>
<li>Seeing repeated negative information can be upsetting. While it’s important to stay informed, you might find it useful to limit your media intake if it is upsetting you or your family.</li>
<li>Be wary of information you find on social media – it may not be true or reliable.</li>
<li>Most importantly be kind and stay at home.</li>
<p>Remember this is a scary time but if we all do our part in helping, keep in contact with our relations and loved ones then everything will be better.</p>

    <h1>Pause Breathe and Repeat</h1>
  <p>Take some slow breaths: in through your nose, then slowly breathe out.
  
      Slow breathing is one of the best ways to lower stress, because it signals to your brain to relax your body.
      Meditation for depression? If you feel a little skeptical at the suggestion, you’re not alone. You might even think it sounds like a recommendation from the people who say depression will improve if you just “Smile more!” or “Think positively!”
      Yes, this alone won't make your symptoms vanish but it will help in calming your mind, and making the depression more manageable.
      Depression can involve a lot of dark thoughts. <br> <br> You might feel hopeless, worthless, or angry at life (or even yourself). This can make meditation seem somewhat different, since it involves increasing your awareness around thoughts and experiences that might have caused your degrading mental health.
      Learning to stay present in the moment can equip you to notice warning signs of a depressive episode early on.
  Meditation can make it easier to pay attention to your emotions as they come up. So, when you begin experiencing negative thought patterns or notice increased irritability, fatigue, or less interest in the things you usually like to do,
      According to 2016 researchTrusted Source, mindfulness-based cognitive therapy, an approach to psychotherapy that incorporates mindfulness meditation practices, can help lower your chances of depression relapse.

<h1>If You are Scared Then Talk To Someone</h1>
<p>The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic may be stressful for people. Fear and anxiety about a new disease and what could happen can be overwhelming and cause strong emotions in adults and children.There are many things you can do—even in the face of this unique crisis—to manage your anxiety and fears. Stay informed—but don't obsessively check the news. It's vital to stay informed, particularly about what's happening in your community, so you can follow advised safety precautions and do your part.
    The governments of the worst affected countries, in terms of number of infections, patients, and mortality levels, such as China, Italy, Spain, and Ecuador, have decreed long periods of self-isolation and/or lockdown, in which citizens have had to stay home.Certain aspects of the disease, such as the uncertainty about how it is spread, its evolution or about the immunity of patients who have been infected, or the absence of a vaccine to counter the disease, have led to an increased feeling of fear among the population 
    <br>A good way to start dealing with what’s going on is to share how you’re feeling with someone you trust. This could be someone in your family or your partner or friend.It also helps if you don’t try to cope with stressful situations on your own. Consider turning to your friends and family. They can provide emotional support through their love, comfort, respect and concern.
